	<h2  style="text-align:center; color:#3b9346;"> How to introduce yourself in an Interview ? </h2>
	<p>
	The highest guaranteed question to come up in an interview regardless of your industry, your job experience and job type is - Tell me about yourself !<br><br>

    You must have handed over your CV/Resume to the interviewer and while glancing through the single page, he pops up this question giving you an opportunity to indulge in a meaningful and interesting conversation. The answer to this question determines the direction in which you want to take the interview. This is your opportunity, your chance to nail the final test and preparing for this is most important before heading out to an interview.<br><br>

    How do you introduce yourself? When you feel particularly insecure, tensed, nervous, anxious with butterflies in your stomach, its your moment to capture when this question comes up.<br><br>

    The question "Tell me about yourself" is basically a variation of the question “ Walk me through your background or CV/Resume !”<br><br>

   But Beware ! Don’t waste this opportunity by simply answering as a long recitation of your resume. This also isn’t the time to mention that you love dancing and scrolling through the internet (yes, candidates jabber on about hobbies and personal preferences while answering this question and landing a weak first impression).<br><br>

   Your answer will dictate the first impression of you, and will set the tone for the entire interview, chance for you to lead with your strongest possibilities of getting selected.<br><br>

   Always remember : ‘Less is More’ . Answer to “ Tell Me About Yourself “ is like a elevator pitch so keep it concise and should not sound memorized . Your introduction should be conversational and natural.
 <br><br>
   In order to appear confident, poised, and professional, break down your answer : <ul style="font-size:20px;">

  <li>   Greeting: Hello, my name is (name). I am a (year in college) studying (branch) at (college name).</li>
  <li> Goal: I am looking for (internship/full-time position) at (employer name).</li>
  <li> Interest/passion: I am interested in (interests related to the company/industry).</li>
  <li> Strengths: I have many skills to contribute including (strengths and skills that are relevant to the employer).</li>
   <li>Brief example of experience: Previously, I have worked at (project name/internship), where I (achievements and/or responsibilities ).</li>
