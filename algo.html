	<p>
	In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a finite sequence of well-defined,
	computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.[1][2] Algorithms are unambiguous specifications
	for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.<br><br>

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time,[3] and in a well-defined formal language[4]
 for calculating a function.[5] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[6] the instructions describe a computation that, 
 when executed, proceeds through a finite[7] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[8] and terminating at a final ending state.
 The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[9]<br><br>

The concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity. Arithmetic algorithms, such as a division algorithm, was used by ancient Babylonian mathematicians c.
 2500 BC and Egyptian mathematicians c. 1550 BC.[10] Greek mathematicians later used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers,[11] 
 and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.[12] Arabic mathematicians such as Al-Kindi in the 9th century used 
 cryptographic algorithms for code-breaking, based on frequency analysis.[13]<br><br>

The word algorithm itself is derived from the 9th-century Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, Latinized Algoritmi.
[14] A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem 
(decision problem) posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability"[15] or "effective method".
[16] Those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's 
Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–37 and 1939.<br><br> <p>
	
<h3>Expressing algorithms</h3>
<p>Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control 
tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical 
algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in 
the statements based on natural language. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer,
 but are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms.<br><br>

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given Turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables 
(see finite-state machine, state transition table and control table for more), as flowcharts and drakon-charts (see state diagram for more), 
or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called "sets of quadruples" (see Turing machine for more).<br><br>

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description, as follows:[38]

1 High-level description
"...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."<br><br>
2 Implementation description
"...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of
 states or transition function."<br><br>
3 Formal description
Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".
For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see Algorithm#Examples.	 </p>
