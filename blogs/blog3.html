<h2  style="text-align:center;"> Infosys Campus Placement Experience Set 1 </h2>
<p>
There are primarily two rounds in the Infosys Recruitment Process for the profile of Associate System Engineer. There are basically two rounds:<br><br>

Aptitude Test:<br>
Earlier, Infosys used to have single criteria to clear this test round. A particular cut-off was made (which isn't made public to students) and students need to clear it with their score to proceed to next rounds but recently, they have made changes in this round.<br><br>
The test consists of 3/4 rounds which are English, Quantitative Ability, and Logical Reasoning. Each section has a particular cut-off and students need to clear each of it with their score. Failure in clearing any one of it would lead you to the group of non-qualified students<br><br>

Interview:<br>

Infosys interview round is cumulative of both Technical and HR Round. It might last for 25-30 minutes involving questions based on DBMS, SQL, C/C++ Basics Questions like Factorial, Fibonacci etc., Puzzles and a few HR questions. Level of questions is not just too low so need to know basic of coding, database, and even OS / Networking concepts. Be ready to take questions based on your CV - internships, projects, volunteer ships and co-curricular activities.<br><br>
Read and research a lot about Infosys. Never say No when the interviewer asks - Do you have any questions for me? Ask about the company's culture and progress associated. I asked about how was his experience in the company. Such questions would surely help you if your answers to technical questions didn't come out well.<br><br>
Here are some of the questions that you can go ask after the interview.<br><br>

P.S :<br>

Prepare well for English Section of Aptitude Test. Many students fail to clear the cut-off score of this section.<br><br>
It's not that Easy: Even my friends who were preparing for CAT weren't able to clear Infosys Aptitude Test. So, prepare well.<br><br>
Join PrepBytes placement program. They will guide you, prepare you for Infosys and related companies. They have video lectures for aptitude as well as CSE subjects which will make your basics clear, which ensures your success in the technical interview as well as written tests.
