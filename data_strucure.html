	<p>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. While there are several basic and advanced structure 
	types, any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.<br><br>
	In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms. Each data structure contains 
	information about the data values, relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data.</p>
	
	<h3> Characteristics of data structures</h3>
	<p>Data structures are often classified by their characteristics. Possible characteristics are:
Linear or non-linear: This characteristic describes whether the data items are arranged in chronological sequence, such as with an array, or in an unordered 
sequence, such as with a graph.<br><br>
Homogeneous or non-homogeneous: This characteristic describes whether all data items in a given repository are of the same type or of various types.
Static or dynamic: This characteristic describes how the data structures are compiled. Static data structures have fixed sizes, structures and memory
 locations at compile time. Dynamic data structures have sizes, structures and memory locations that can shrink or expand depending on the use.</p>
	
<h3> Types of data structures </h3>
<p>Data structure types are determined by what types of operations are required or what kinds of algorithms are going to be applied. These types include:<br><br>

Arrays- An array stores a collection of items at adjoining memory locations. Items that are the same type get stored together so that the position of each 
element can be calculated or retrieved easily. Arrays can be fixed or flexible in length.
Stacks- A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that operations are applied. This order could be last in first out (LIFO) or first in first 
out (FIFO).<br><br>
Queues- A queue stores a collection of items similar to a stack; however, the operation order can only be first in first out.
Linked lists- A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item as well as a 
reference, or link, to the next item in the list.<br><br>
Trees- A tree stores a collection of items in an abstract, hierarchical way. Each node is linked to other nodes and can have multiple sub-values, also known 
as children.<br><br>
Graphs- A graph stores a collection of items in a non-linear fashion. Graphs are made up of a finite set of nodes, also known as vertices, and lines that
 connect them, also known as edges. These are useful for representing real-life systems such as computer networks.<br><br>
Tries- A trie, or keyword tree, is a data structure that stores strings as data items that can be organized in a visual graph.<br><br>
Hash tables- A hash table, or a hash map, stores a collection of items in an associative array that plots keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to
 convert an index into an array of buckets that contain the desired data item.<br><br>
These are considered complex data structures as they can store large amounts of interconnected data. Examples of primitive, or basic, data structures are 
integers, floats, Booleans and characters.</p><br><br>
