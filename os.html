	<h3>The Operating System is a program with the following features − </h3>

<p>An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the software and the computer hardware.<br>
It is an integrated set of specialized programs used to manage overall resources and operations of the computer.<br>
It is a specialized software that controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, including application programs and 
other system software.<br> </p>

<h3>   Objectives of Operating System </h3>
<p>
The objectives of the operating system are −
To make the computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner.<br>
To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users.<br>
To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system.<br>
To act as an intermediary between the hardware and its users, making it easier for the users to access and use other resources.<br>
To manage the resources of a computer system.<br>
To keep track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, and mediating conflicting requests from different programs and users.<br>
To provide efficient and fair sharing of resources among users and programs.<br>
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Operating System </h3>
<p><Here is a list of some of the most prominent characteristic features of Operating Systems −<br>
Memory Management − Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what part of it is in use by whom, what part is not in use, etc. and allocates the memory when 
a process or program requests it.<br>
Processor Management − Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required.<br>
Device Management − Keeps track of all the devices. This is also called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.<br>
File Management − Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.<br>
Security − Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords and other similar techniques.
Job Accounting − Keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and/or users.<br>
Control Over System Performance − Records delays between the request for a service and from the system.<br>
Interaction with the Operators − Interaction may take place via the console of the computer in the form of instructions. The Operating System acknowledges 
the same, does the corresponding action, and informs the operation by a display screen.<br>
Error-detecting Aids − Production of dumps, traces, error messages, and other debugging and error-detecting methods.<br>
Coordination Between Other Software and Users − Coordination and assignment of compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other software to the various users of
 the computer systems.
