	<h2 style="text-align:center;">  How can a Non-CSE student get placed IT/Software company in 2-3 months?    </h2>
	<p>    This blog is of great use for students who are from Non CSE branch and still have 2-3 months in hand before they appear for their dream company. Even if companies have started visiting your campus; DON'T WORRY. With continuous effort and hard work, you will get placed in a good software company.<br><br>

P.S: This blog is for students who are aiming package of 4-9 lacs in a good software company.<br><br>

Being a Non-CSE student, you might not have done coding before or you might have just attended a C programming class in your first semester.<br><br>

In case you don't have a practice of writing code, start solving coding problems. No need of going too much into tough algos unless you are preparing for companies like Amazon, Microsoft, DirectI etc. Start with basic coding questions, the motive is to develop the habit of writing code and develop the ability to approach a code.<br>
You need to have considerable knowledge of few Computer Science subjects like Operating System, Data Structures Concepts, DBMS. These are the three very important subjects. It is good to know Computer Networks as well but OS and DBMS are more important to know.<br><br>
Take mock tests, solve lots of objective questions, go through previous interview experiences
Don't take the interview for granted, make sure you take Mock Interviews. It will not only boost your confidence but also you will get to know more about your preparation.
<br><br>
Now the BIG Question!
So many things to do in just 2-3 months, How will I complete these many things in JUST 2-3 months?
Let me tell you what mistakes students generally do, and this is reality based on the many real instances.<br>

They are confused about where to start coding and because some random blog or your senior asked you to practice coding, you pick up coding questions & start solving the same. It may happen you pick up very difficult question and lose your hope & interest. Also, while you are coding you may face several difficulties and you have no one to help. ULTIMATELY YOU STOP CODING!
Talking about knowing the concepts of DS, DBMS, OS.<br><br>

You can go onto following respective books of these subjects but time is less and book has too many stuff some of which are really not important from placement perspective and hence you waste lots of time & get even more anxious.
You can ask one of your CSE friends to teach you the required stuff but the fact is your friend himself/herself must be in a hassle of placement. If you get such a friend it is great, else you will waste day after day waiting for an appointment with your friend.<br><br>
You may go on to read important questions from the internet but that will only give the answers to those questions. There is a great chance that when real-time interviews happen you will be asked some other question or some conceptual question & you will fail to answer.<br>
You go on to watch lectures available on the internet, but that again will just be tutorial of the subjects with lots of material which you not even need to know taking lots of your time and you will still remain confused.<br><br>
You will spend hours searching for right lectures for different subjects and with so many nonrelevant contents available it may happen that you waste lots of your time and you get nothing relevant.
These are very small mistakes that thousands of students do, losing the opportunity of their dream placement or even worse they remain unplaced.
